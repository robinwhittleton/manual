        <h1>Art</h1>
        <p>When you create a new Standard Ebooks draft using the <code class="bash">create-draft</code> tool, you’ll already have templates for the cover and titlepage images present in <code class="path">./images/</code>.</p>
        <p>Text in these SVG files is represented as text, not paths, so you can edit them using a text editor and not an SVG editor. Then, the <code class="bash">build-images</code> tool converts these text-based source images into path-based compiled images, for distribution in the final epub file. We do this so to avoid having to distribute the font files along with the epub.</p>
        <p>To develop cover and titlepage images, you must have the free <a href="https://github.com/theleagueof/league-spartan">League Spartan</a> and <a href="https://github.com/theleagueof/sorts-mill-goudy">Sorts Mill Goudy</a> fonts installed on your system.</p>
        <section id="complete-list-of-files">
            <h2>Complete list of files</h2>
            <p>A complete set of image source files consists of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code class="path">./images/cover.source.jpg</code>: The full source image used for the cover art, in as high a resolution as possible. Can be of any image format, but typically we end up with JPGs.</li>
                <li><code class="path">./images/cover.jpg</code>: A cropped part of the source image that will serve as the actual image file we use in the cover. Must be exactly 1400w × 2100h.</li>
                <li><code class="path">./images/cover.svg</code>: The SVG source file for the cover, with any text represented as actual, editable text. Must be exactly 1400w × 2100h pixels. Since the final cover image SVG has the text converted to paths, we keep this file around to make it easier to make changes to the cover in the future.</li>
                <li><code class="path">./src/epub/images/cover.svg</code>: The final SVG cover image. This image should be exactly like <code class="path">./images/cover.svg</code>, but with the text converted to paths.
                    <p>This image is generated by the <code class="path">build-images</code> tool.</p>
                </li>
                <li><code class="path">./images/titlepage.svg</code>: The SVG source file for the titlepage, with any text represented as actual, editable text. Must be exactly 1400 pixels wide, but the height must exactly match the text height plus some padding (described below).</li>
                <li><code class="path">./src/epub/images/titlepage.svg</code>: The final SVG titlepage image, with text converted to paths just like the cover page.
                    <p>This image is generated by the <code class="path">build-images</code> tool.</p>

                    <h4>US-PD clearance</h4>
                    <p>The paintings we use are all in the U.S. public domain (US-PD). Your task is to locate a painting suitable for the kind of book you’re producing, and then demonstrate that the painting is indeed in the U.S. public domain.</p>
                    <p>U.S. copyright law is complicated. Because of this, <strong>we require that you provide a link to a page scan of a 1922-or-older book that reproduces the painting you selected.</strong> <em>This is a hard requirement</em> to demonstrate that the painting you selected is in fact in the U.S. public domain. Just because a painting is very old, or Wikipedia says it’s PD, or it’s PD in a country besides the U.S., doesn’t necessarily mean it actually <em>is</em> PD in the U.S.</p>
                    <section id="clearance-procedure">
                        <h5>Clearance procedure</h5>
                        <p>To actually demonstrate that a painting is PD, you must locate a reproduction of that painting in a 1922-or-older book.</p>
                        <p>This can be quite difficult. Many people find this to be the most time-consuming part of the ebook production process.</p>
                        <p>Because of the difficulty, finding suitable cover at is <em>all about compromise</em>. You’re unlikely to find the perfect cover image. You’ll find a lot of paintings that would be great matches, but that you can’t find reproductions of and thus we can’t use. So, be ready to compromise.</p>
                        <p>Note that in <code class="path">./images/cover.svg</code>, the black title and author box always goes in the lower half of the work. Thus, paintings in which some important detail would be obscured by the box cannot be used.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Before you can go looking for a reproduction of a specific painting to prove its PD status, you have to find a suitable painting to begin with. <a href="https://www.wikiart.org/">Wikiart.org</a> is a great resource to search for paintings by keyword. Museum online collections are another good place to look for inspiration.
                                <p>Once you find a potential candidate you can start researching its PD status.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Many museum online catalogs have a “bibliography” or “references” section for each painting in their collection. This is usually a list of books in which the painting was either mentioned or reproduced. This is a good shortcut to finding the names of books in which a painting was reproduced, and if you’re lucky, a search for the book title in Google Books will turn up scans.</li>
                            <li>Visit <a href="https://books.google.com/">Google Books</a>, <a href="https://www.hathitrust.org">HathiTrust</a>, and the <a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a> to begin searching for books where your art is reproduced.
                                <p>(Note that if your IP address is not in the U.S., many book archives like Google Books and HathiTrust may disable book previews.)</p>
                                <p>When searching for cover art, remember that artist names and painting titles may be spelled in many different ways. Often a painting went by multiple titles, or if the title was not in English, by many different translations. Your best bet is to simply search for an artist’s last name, and not the painting title.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Once you locate a book with reproductions, open the book up in thumbnail view and quickly eyeball the pages to see if the artwork is reproduced there.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <section id="gotchas">

                            <ul>
                                <li>In older books it was common to have <em>etchings</em> of paintings. Etchings are not strict reproductions, and so we cannot count them for PD clearance.
                                    <p>Additionally, it was common for painters to produce several different versions of the same artwork. These different versions are also not enough for PD clearance. The version you find in print must exactly match the scan you located online.</p>
                                    <p>Before completing PD clearance, carefully compare the reproduction in the page scan with the high-resolution scan to ensure they are the same painting. Small details like the position of trees, clouds, reflections, or water are good ways to check if the painting is identical, or if you’re looking at a different version.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>Sometimes the catalog record for a book has an incorrect publication year. Please verify the page scan of the copyright page to ensure the book is 1922 or older.</li>

                    <ol type="1">
                        <li>“Contributors” are a “contributor descriptor,” like <code class="html">translated by</code>, followed by the contributor name on a new line.</li>
                        <li>The first contributor descriptor line begins 150px below the last author line.</li>
                        <li>Contributor descriptor lines are 40px tall, all lowercase, in the Sorts Mill Goudy Italic font.</li>
                        <li>The contributor name begins 20px below the contributor descriptor line.</li>

                        <li>If there is more than one contributor of the same type (like multiple translators), they are listed on one line. If there are two, separate them with <code class="html">AND</code>. If there are more than two, separate them with commas, and <code class="html">AND</code> after the final comma. Example: <i><a href="/ebooks/hermann-hesse/siddhartha/gunther-olesch_anke-dreher_amy-coulter_stefan-langer_semyon-chaichenets">Siddhartha</a></i>, by Hermann Hesse.</li>
                        <li>If there is more than one contributor type (like both a translator and an illustrator), the next contributor descriptor begins 80px after the last contributor name.</li>
