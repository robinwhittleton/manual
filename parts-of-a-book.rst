###############################
Parts of a book and their order
###############################

****************
Major partitions
****************

We can consider that all books, including ebooks, can be considered to consist of these major partitions:

- *Cover*: the outer appearance of the book, usually consisting of an image, the title of the book and the author's name.

- *Frontmatter*: material which appears prior to the main content of the work, which might typically include such items as a dedication, an epigraph, an introduction and so on.

- *Bodymatter*: the main content of the book.

- *Backmatter*: material which follows the main content, which might typically include an appendix, an afterword, and so on.

These terms become important when building the Table of Contents (ToC) (:path:`./src/epub/toc.xhtml`). The 'Landmarks' section of the ToC requires items to be labelled with the appropriate partition. See XXXXX for more information about the ToC.
